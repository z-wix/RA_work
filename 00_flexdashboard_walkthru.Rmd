## Data Summarization

- Data summarization (as part of an **exploratory analysis**) is all about discovery: What is your data saying?
  + Describe data with numerical summaries (i.e., **statistics**).
  + Visualize data with graphical summaries.
- How we summarize depends on whether the data is **discrete** or **continuous**.
  + Discrete is also called qualitative or categorical.
  + Continuous is also called quantitative or numerical.
- We will use both dplyr and ggplot2 to summarize data.

---

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

mpg
```

## Describing Discrete Data

The simplest numeric summary for a discrete variable is a **count**.

```{r}
mpg %>% 
  count(manufacturer)
```

---

- Now get a count by both manufacturer and drive type to produce a "tidy" **cross-tab**.
- Save this as a new data frame `car_count`.

---

```{r}
car_count <- mpg %>% 
  count(manufacturer, drv)

car_count
```

## Visualizing Discrete Data

ggplot2 uses a consistent **grammar of graphics** built with **layers**.

1. Data – Data to visualize.
2. Aesthetics – Mapping graphical elements to data.
3. Geometries – Or “geom,” the graphic representing the data.

---

Plot our `car_count` data (note how `+` is different from `%>%`).

```{r}
ggplot(car_count, aes(x = manufacturer, y = n)) +
  geom_col()
```

---

- Let’s visualize a second variable. Add the aesthetic `fill = drv`.
- The geom `position` argument is set to `"stack"` by default. Try `"dodge"` and `"fill"` instead.

---

```{r}
ggplot(car_count, aes(x = manufacturer, y = n, fill = drv)) +
  geom_col()
```

---

```{r}
ggplot(car_count, aes(x = manufacturer, y = n, fill = drv)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

---

```{r}
ggplot(car_count, aes(x = manufacturer, y = n, fill = drv)) +
  geom_col(position = "fill")
```

## Describing Continuous Data

The simplest numeric summary for a continuous variable is a **mean**.

```{r}
mpg %>%
  summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))
```

Note that `summarize()` is a more general version of `count()`.

---

- Compute the mean of both highway and city miles per gallon.
- We can also compute the **mode**, **median**, **variance**, **standard deviation**, **minimum**, **maximum**, etc.

---

```{r}
mpg %>% 
  summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy), avg_cty = mean(cty))
```

## Visualizing Continuous Data

With discrete data, we had to create a summary before we created a plot (which is typical).

For continuous data, we can often plot without a summary. Let’s plot the **distribution** of highway miles per gallon.

---

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

---

Visualize the relationship between highway and city MPG.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = cty)) +
  geom_point()
```

---

- What do we do if there is **overplotting**? There’s a geom for that.
- Play with the `size` and `alpha` geom arguments.
- Add a `geom_smooth()` layer.

---

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = cty)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 3, alpha = 0.5)
```

---

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = cty)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

## Describing Discrete and Continuous Data

**Grouped summaries** provide a powerful solution for describing a combination of discrete and continuous data.

```{r}
mpg %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    avg_hwy = mean(hwy),
    avg_cty = mean(cty)
  )
```

---

- `count()` is a **wrapper** around a grouped summary with `n()`.
- Grouping by a discrete variable is equivalent to filtering the data separately for each value of the group variable.
- Now group by manufacturer and fuel type and arrange the summary in descending order by average highway MPG.

---

```{r}
mpg %>% 
  group_by(manufacturer, fl) %>% 
  summarize(
    n = n(), 
    avg_hwy = mean(hwy), 
    avg_cty = mean(cty)
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_hwy))
```

## Visualizing Discrete and Continuous Data

There are geoms specific to visualizing the relationship between discrete and continuous data.

---

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = manufacturer, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

But there are a variety of other options to quickly create impressive visuals.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = cty)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

---

- Add the aesthetic `color = fl`.
- Add the layer `facet_wrap(~ manufacturer)`.

---

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = cty, color = fl)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

---

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = cty, color = fl)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ manufacturer)
```

## Exercise 0

Open the exercise via the RStudio Cloud workspace and do the following.

1. Load the tidyverse.
2. Explore `mpg` using the functions we've covered.
3. Provide a few interesting descriptions (numeric summaries) and visualizations (graphical summaries).
4. Practice good coding conventions: Comment often, write in consecutive lines of code using the `%>%`, and use the demonstrated style (e.g., variable names, spacing within functions).
5. Export the R script and upload to Learning Suite.
