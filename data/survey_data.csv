Mine was set up for Presta Valves, a different bike valve than I have, but can be interchangeable to work for the standard ones most people have (Schrader Valves). I lost the instructions and thought it didn't work, but luckily found a helpful Amazon review to help me realize I needed to set it up properly for my valve type.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR SCHRADER SETUP: You have to unscrew the round donut cap first, then pull the rubber piece out, then deep inside you will find a hard plastic piece (possibly still stuck in the rubber piece). Turn that hard plastic piece around so the bigger hole is facing inside the pump and the little nipple is facing out toward you. Then put the rubber piece in, small hole in first to fit over the nipple, bigger hole out towards you. Then screw the round donut back on. Ta da! Now just lift the top lever on the back of the pump, place it on your bike tire valve, clamp the lever back down to seal it better, and pump away.

It absolutely works, I just tried it. =)"

GO SLOW and don't try to do too much when getting started. Otherwise bigtime hand cramps, think claw. I have painful rheumatoid arthritis in my hands particularly so I started with one rep of 5 on the green until I could do one rep of 10 every 2nd day or so. It took a couple of weeks before I could move some of the exercises to the yellow version. Always remember to pause (stop) for 3-5 seconds during each exercise holding the springs compressed for optimal workouts.

Now I use the green to warm up then move onto the yellow. I also have the blue and red versions and mix in a single rep of 3-5 on some exercises. Here's a link to the exercises that has a pdf. format for printing out - [...] . I do all of the exercises and my hands are in great shape now. Oh, on the off days I massage both hands and all fingers, that helps a lot too. Hope this helps, it helped me, and I'm 62. 35 years ago I had powerful hands and grip I want that back."

My last one had begun breaking springs (I jog on the trampoline several times a week), and  rather than buy another spring one, figured I'd try this out.

Secondly, not have springs is a surprise pleasure: no more squeaking, and the bands seem to add more resistance, without pressure.  And lastly, although I don't need the folding feature, it's a great option to have.

Although, if you are strictly a hunter and rarely target shoot, these may be a waste, because you aren't going to be needing 100 of them. But for 20 dollars, they will certainly last anyone a decent amount of time, even if you regularly target shoot.

So in summary, just really good targets. I actually seen them on some shooting videos on youtube and liked how high visibility they were for target shooting, so I decided to ""pull the trigger"" on them, so to speak."

I've had an old RCBS Jr since the early 70's and the ram is as snug as it ever was but after tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition loaded through it, it was self polished so smoothly that the handle would fall driving the ram up which was not only aggravating but could result in pinched fingers.  The handle of the old press sticks out away from the press at an angle so it could fall and was also somewhat in the way when not actively using it.  The handle of this press lays back toward the press so it won't fall from it's own weight and it's out of the way.  The Amazon photo shows the press leaning forward, not the way it's actually mounted so it's a little misleading.  I got a Forster press a couple of years ago and it's also a great press but, without a lot of boring detail, I needed a conventional press for some jobs including some large cased cartridges.  This one is well made and well finished.  At least at one point, my understanding is that the casting for the press was done in China and the rough casting was machined and finished in the USA.  I don't know if the casting is still made in China or not.  The press was labeled made in USA.  In any case mine is well finished and operates  smoothly.  It's a big, solid press - honestly probably overkill if you're not loading some fairly large cases.  It makes for a long stroke of the handle to raise the ram.  Incidentally one gripe I've heard of this press is that the casting is so sorry they have to put in a steel insert to screw the die into.  Not so.  That black insert is a reducer or adapter for the standard 7/8"" X 14 TPI dies.  Screw that adapter out and the press will take the 1 1/4"" X 12 dies for cartridges based on the 50 BMG cartridge.  Much ink has been spilled about the primer seater.  While I have other options for seating primers, I have used the seater on this press and I find it works just fine.  In fact I like it better than the one on my old RCBS JR.  I think I do like the one on the Forster better.  And the ""horrendous"" primer catcher I read about - mine works as it's supposed to 90% of the time or better.  I've actually counted the number of times the primers has popped out of the catcher - 5 to 10% of the time.  That said my loading is done out in a workshop with a concrete floor so if a spent primer falls on the floor it gets swept up with the sawdust and what ever else may be on the floor.  If you want absolute control of your spent primers cause the wife doesn't like spent primers in the carpet, get a Forster - seriously.  The Rock Chucker Supreme a good press.  I like it.  It's big, heavy, solid and will do the job."

As a result, less than two thirds of the burner is lit when on an even surface (resulting in uneven heat on pots and pans).  If I tip the stove (and connected tank) about 30 the opposite direction, the burner becomes fully lit.  But it can't be used at such an extreme angle because the stove (and tank) simply tip over; even if nailed down, anything placed on the bowl would simply slide off.  Ugh!

Because of this major flaw, I purchased Coleman's competing product (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coleman-PefectFlow-1-Burner-Stove/dp/B0009PUR5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coleman PefectFlow 1-Burner Stove</a>).

The Stansport stove does has a much smaller regulator than the Coleman, which makes it easier to fit into my backpack.  But with its crooked burner, I've tossed the Stansport into a side bag as an emergency back-up, and just use my Coleman stove but with the Stansport base.

Maybe I got a rare lemon.  But if this is typical of Stansport QC, play it safe and get the Coleman stove."

I am new to hammock camping, but decided to give it a go after realizing how lightweight a solution this is for backpacking. You will have to adjust to a cooler backside at night though. I also preferred to use my sweatshirt wadded up rather than my pack pillow under my head. Otherwise sleeping in a hammock is ten times more comfortable than on the ground, which I never anticipated, since I'm usually a belly-sleeper! The entry is easy, but takes some getting used to. Open the velcro and sit in the middle of the hammock, scoot your butt back and let the weight of you laying inside close the velcro! Then when you need to escape just stick your foot through the velcro.

I found it great to hang my shoes from the line inside so they weren't outside on the cold ground gathering dew overnight, and then it's easier to put them on in the middle of the night if nature calls. I also purchased the snakeskins to pack them in which makes setup and takedown much quicker, but packing it becomes a little more awkward because the skins make the hammock a little stiff and difficult to pack down into your bag. I didn't have any issues with condensation inside but I did have a few problems on occasion with the rain fly stakes staying in the ground on windy evenings.

However, those containers were just slightly too small to pack my husband's lunches.  But many of the other thermoses on the market were too large and bulky.  This 16 ounce food jar was the perfect compromise, comes with a stainless steel spoon attached to the lid and has a stainless steel lining.  Since I'm particular about not having hot food served in plastic, this was a big bonus for me.  The red color is also very attractive.

My complaints?  First, the cap is actually two pieces.  There's a black plastic insert that is covered by a thin stainless steel out covering.  They are not supposed to come apart.  However, when I was twisting the cap tight and the cap kept turning and turning, I lifted the stainless part off and realized that the glue had failed and they had come apart.  I sure hope that this isn't a system wide manufacturing defect, but it was definitely a bummer.
Second, I can feel a lot of heat coming off the neck and the inner cap (which is plastic).  This tells me that if that much heat is being released, then the food jar is not doing the absolute best it could be to insulate the food.
Finally, the cap is too small to use as a little bowl.  Given that it is plastic, I probably wouldn't want to anyways.  But some of the larger thermoses have caps that you can invert and pour your soup into.  Not a complaint as much as a suggestion if they ever want to redesign the item.

Its too large to conceal reasonably without wearing a winter coat! I still enjoy the blade profile and the uses of this knife are intriguing. Mix between a Karambit and a push dagger. I am a fan of the style. The blade came sharp. The weight is significant. I am overall impressed. However if you plan to carry it daily consider the little brother of this knife!

The ad says 12"" blade in one spot, and 18"" in another, I ordered it and got an 18"" blade.  This thing is more like a sword than a machete its very heavy and thick bladed which is great for heavy chopping, but anything I need to do chopping this is capable of, I'll use a hawk.  If you're looking for a very thick bladed heavy hitter this is your machete.  But if you genuinely want a true short blade machete, go with their Kukri or an Ontario 12"".

Needless to say this monster isn't going in my canoe pack.  But at the same time its hard to be too judgmental of Coldsteel since it wasn't them who mislabeled the ad.  But even so its just more machete than is really necessary for what a machete's actual purpose is."

I bought it because I pulled my lower back a few years ago and have had stiffness and soreness issues with it when I tried to workout again. Using this table was a big part of my being able to get back into my workout routine.

I weighed 230lbs when I first started using it and it was very sturdy, although I'm not sure if this is true for anyone upwards of 230lbs. I weigh 195lbs now and use it for inverted sit ups and to stretch my back occassionaly and it continues to prove it's sturdiness.

The hardest part i can remember was putting it together... but with the instructions it took me a little over 30mins to get it working. Also, when you need to remove the table from the mount, it can be a little tricky getting it back on the mount again. And over time the black plastic pieces on the foot stand tends to slide out, just keep an eye out for them and put the back when they come off. I have a room with my fitness equipment, so i don't know how cumbersome this machine would be to continiously take it down and put it back up.

Overall this has been one of my best purchases."

If you do not have a beaver tail or my love handles I don't expect you will have any issue with the gun digging in.  sitting while wearing this holster is mildly uncomfortable.  I don't have any issues going for a short drive but i probably would not elect to use this holster if i was sitting all day.  for such a scenario a high quality holster such as a crossbreed is probably the right fit.  this holster also is not rigid and it collapses after drawing the weapon, making it very difficult to re-holster.  gun fights aren't won on your ability to re-holster and i honestly hope i never in my life have to draw on someone so as a conceal carry rig i don't mind the re-holstering difficulty.  I would not bring this holster to the range where i am constantly re-holstering.  so now, where i think this little holster really excels.....it is simple, minimalist, affordable, and extremely easy to put on and take off.  the small profile makes it trivial to just carry the gun around the house in the holster to set nearby wherever i happen to be at the moment.  i wouldn't lug a crossbreed or blackhawk SERPA around the house all day or put them on my nightstand in the evening.  next, and most importantly, is the ease of putting it on and taking it off ensures that i do in fact put it on EVERY time i leave the house.  if it takes me several minutes to redo my pants and put on a belt every time i step out of the house just to run down to the store for a bottle of milk i'm probably not going to do it.  i can have this thing on and off in 3 seconds and that means i will always use it."

They are a few ounces lighter than the dromedary, which comes from using a lighter weight material.  I believe this is the same material as the MSR hydromedary.  This causes these bags to be a little less durable and prone to tearing.  If you take care of your equipment and don't carry this by the cap, it will still last you many seasons.  The hydration hose and shower attachments that are made from the dromedary will also fit these, adding to the versatility.  Both bags are compatible with the MSR miniworks filter.  I have found drinking straight from the bag to be a little difficult with the larger bag, especially when it is full. The cap can either  be taken completely off, or there is also a nipple that can be opened and smaller diameter pore spout that can be opened, which is what I usually drink from.  Filling it straight from a stream or lake can also be difficult because the bag collapses from the outside pressure of the water.  If you are looking to shave a few ounces off your bladder, then this is definitely a good way to go.  If you are rougher on your gear and need something stronger, then you may want to go with the dromedary."

The Katana is very well made and also very sharp. I enjoy the leather wrap over the cotton since it provides a better grip.  The tsuba is a little small but that doesn't bother me to much, and you can just replace it with a different one if you want to. the United Cutlery logo on the blade is small and insignificant, and has some nice inscriptions on the opposite side which make up for the logo.  Blade is straight with minor, and when I say minor its like barely noticeable unless you really examine every inch of the blade, as I was saying...minor wave on the Mune. Don't take this as that the blade is not straight, blade is perfectly straight. the forge line is slightly waved toward the center of the blade, that is all.

It has a double Hi, which is kinda cool since I haven't seen many Katanas with 2 grooves.

Have done some test swings with the sword, the results were more than awesome.  Cut through 1 tatami without any issues, have not tried more yet as that was my last one.

Update: measured sword after I received a different one I had ordered. Sword measures 43.5""!?!? Not complaining about this, I was just seeing how close the 41.25"" measurement in the description was.

5 stars, and would highly recommend this katana for the price it is offered for and basically for any price it goes for. well worth it."

The black bag i received is completley different. Dimensions are off by 1/4 inch on all sides. The quality is much poorer. It is obviously a lower grade of cotton.---about the same or less than cheap cloth grocery bags The bottom is so thin, you can see right through it! The stiching is poor. It is single stiched. Loose stiched and edging is fraying. Bag says ""rapid dominance on it.""

Also, the straps on my wife's bag run the length of the bag and are sewn with the ""X pattern"" the straps on my bag are single horizontal stiched.

I don't understand how I can order 2 copies of the same bag from the same manufacturer and get 2 completely different products. The Green bag from ""GT"" that my wife recieved is very sturdy and I would highly recommend it. The bag I got from ""rapid dominance"" is an obvious knockoff or horrible quality.

*UPDATE  8/30/15*

I've been using the Condor Bushlore knife for well over a year now and it has exceeded any and all tasks I've given it. I have however had a problem with the sheath. I had been walking around my favorite campsite and reached for my knife, normally at my right hip. Lo and behold, it wasn't there! The knife and sheath were gone. After nearly an hour of searching and retracing my steps, I found it. The bottom stitchings of the belt loop had been clipped when I sheathed it last, causing it to fall off my belt. I've since turned the sheath into a dangler type sheath that seems popular in the Bushcraft community. Be careful when you're sheathing your knife. Take care of your knife and it'll take care of you."

Every year I take my family of 7 camping and we struggle to cook meals. We balance our stove on a cooler, hunch over for what seems like hours, just to scramble some eggs. Then we would open our gallon jugs and run water over our dishes to clean them. This camp stove is probably one of the best purchases I've made in a long time.
It's the perfect height for cooking and prepping. The open grate ledge holds my coleman 2 burner stove with some extra room to spare. The propane tank does hang off the edge though. My other complaint with the fold out table part is that the prongs that attach to the main legs seem to be just a little too short. It doesn't look like they were bent, more like a manufacturer defect. I used some force, bent them out a little, and didn't have any more problems.
The paper towel holder...well, just throw that away because it's worthless. Didn't stay suctioned for more than a minute
The storage shelves perfectly held all of my condiments, non stick spray, sponges and dish soap. I love that they're adjustable!
The hooks held all of my utensils plus my cutting board.
The sink was so useful although I wish it had a drain plug. All of our clean dishes went right into the mesh basket on the side to dry.
All of my pans fit perfectly under the table. That shelf can be put on either set of cross bars and holds plenty of weight.
The lantern hook, while GREAT in theory, is not meant to hold a regular size camping lantern. I have a basic, square coleman lantern and it caused the pole to lean out. I felt like it could snap if I kept using it so a lighter/smaller lantern is a must on there.
All in all, it made our most recent camping trip so, so much easier. Everything stayed organized, clean, and my back was saved from having to hunch down to prep and cook meals.
It sets up in just a few minutes and easily breaks down.
It should be noted that the picture of it folded up is a bit deceptive. It is flat on the front but the back has the side table sticking out an inch or two. It is not fully compact like a suitcase would be. With that said, it fits in the back of my minivan with no problems at all. I take 2 Rubbermaid totes with supplies and food and it sat right on top of the bins. I put the smooth side facing in and used the back as a little storage area by putting beach towels on the rack.

Edited to add:
This has been used several times since my review. Mostly for weekend music festivals. When I said to toss the paper towel holder...scratch that. It is PERFECT to help level our camp stove if the kitchen isn't set up on perfectly flat ground. We've kept it for that reason alone.
The kitchen still looks brand new and is a huge hit everywhere we take it. Definitely well worth the less than $100 we paid for it."

My only negative is that the cuffs is too narrow, the stitching around the cuff popped slightly the first time I pulled them on.  The gloves are not compromised by the stitching, yet; but they are still new."

This is my second pedometer, I used the Nintendo DS game Personal Trainer: Walking for over a year and I use a Garmin GPS watch for running. I am very impressed with the Fitbit and it is easily better than the Nintendo game (even though it is also a decent pedometer itself).

The device is well made. It doesn't feel like it would break open if it got dropped. The button is hard enough to push that you won't push it by accident, but easy to push when you want to. I was surprised to see people recommending a pedometer leash for it, the thing clips to whatever I am wearing and does not budge. Jeans, a belt, running shorts, it doesn't matter, it's snug. So snug that attaching it to softer clothing takes a bit more work to get it attached. It does include a holster type clip for thicker clothes/belts, but I have not had to use it.

The display isn't too bright and is easy to read inside. Outside in bright sunlight it is almost impossible to read unless you shield it. Which is fine, the only issue is when you are trying to verify you started/stopped an activity outside. When using the device to sleep the light from the display is not bright enough to be a distraction (not that it lights up much, just sometimes after it hasn't moved in awhile).

I wear the thing everyday, all day, and the battery has been fantastic. I have charged it once for an hour during the week and the web page still reports the battery level as ""high"". The only time you can see the battery level on the Fitbit itself is when you plug it in to your computer using the adapter, it gives you a battery indicator then which has been almost useless. I plugged in one day and the battery indicator came up saying it was empty. I removed it and reinserted it on its adapter and the display said full. Luckily when it does it's wireless sync it records the battery level there more accurately. It's been 3-4 days since the last full charge and the web page still says ""high"".

For daily use it has been fun to use and track my activity. You can press the button at any time to see your calories, steps, mileage, floors climbed, and your activity level (displayed as a flower).

How accurate is it? That's hard to tell. Unlike some other pedometers that only measure steps after a few seconds of activity as to avoid counting shifts as you sit, the Fitbit seems to measure as soon as you stand up and walk. It seems to do a great job of not counting shifts as you sit as a step. It will count bumpy car/bicycle rides as random steps though, but there is no avoiding that unless you could turn it off. Comparing the results to what I would get with my former pedometer, it seems pretty similar.

Mileage of course is off by a decent amount. I don't find that important, since even if I calibrated it for my step, throughout the day I take different size steps depending on what I am doing, so it always going to be off. This does make activity tracking fairly pointless though. For instance I walked for an hour, using my GPS watch or phone app I know I walk at about a 13-minute mile. The Fitbit recorded it as 17 minute miles, although it did a good job of counting my increased pace with the step count saying I was ""very active"" for that hour. If you want to track your walking/running activities, you are better off getting an app for your phone. I will say for everyday just walking around, it's not bad, and it's fine for comparing the mileage one day to the next with what it tracks.

The floors climbed counter is surprisingly good. The GPS watch I use for running has an altimeter and the altitude on it never really settles down, even when sitting still so I was skeptical about the Fitbit's accuracy. It works well though, I go up about 6 flights of stairs a day, and the Fitbit is always right on the money unless I did a lot of walking around where the gradual hills may add up to an extra floor climbed for the day.

Sleep accuracy is another recording I was surprised at. The included wristband you insert the Fitbit into is very light and hardly noticeable, I got used to it to the point I forget it's on. To measure your sleep you press the button to start an activity when you get into bed. The issue here is that if you lie very still, the Fitbit thinks you are asleep. I noticed usually I fidget though so it has done a pretty good job of detecting my sleep. When you look at the chart the next morning it tells you where you woke up, which doesn't necessarily mean you woke up, you could have turned over or moved.  Usually you can tell if you were really awake though if it lasted more than a minute. The waking up part has been a bit iffy if you don't remember to hit the button again to stop the activity. Sometimes it says I fell back asleep when I knew I hadn't.

And finally to tie it all together is the web page. Which is nothing short of great (unless you want to count calories). Histories for everything it measures, activity logging, badges you win for passing checkpoints, places to share/compete with friends. I have a Withings scale which automatically imports it's data to the Fitbit web page as well. The web page is very well done. For calorie counting it would be nice if they could do a deal with the Daily Plate, because the food database on Fitbit is just not very good.

I highly recommend the Fitbit. If you are someone who gets motivated by stats it will get you out and moving. I found myself more likely to get out from my desk at work or took the half empty garbage out just to make sure I am getting some steps/floors climbed in to meet my daily goal. I would say the Fitbit with the webpage is the almost perfect pedometer. It's not great for exercising logging, but no pedometer is. If you want to measure your basic walking activity, you couldn't ask for more."

Adjust them so that the little ""wing"" supports your palm as you sit on the bike with your wrists straight, and they will help minimize hand numbness and forearm strain on longer rides.

The assembly was straightforward without major problems. The only tool needed is an Allen wrench, which is included in the hardware packet. The instructions are clearly written, *and* show nice schematics for the assembling process (one reviewer pointed out that the instructions were confusing... maybe the manufacturer re-edited the instruction sheet).

The stands work like a charm on my classic beach cruiser with the fat tires, although I can't use it on the back wheel (as recommended) because the fender doesn't fit. But it holds steady, nice and firm on the front wheel.

My MTB with 1.75 tires however does not so well. Here too, I only can use the stand on the front wheel as I retrofitted the bike with fenders. But he tire sits slack, and the bike kept loosing balance and falling over with stand and all. I followed a reviewers' advice and got some water pipe insulation. This sort off corrected the problem, but it still sways in a scary manner and tends to fall over when accidentally hit.

CONCLUSION:
*If your bicycle has fenders, be prepared to use the stand on the front wheel only. It will work.
*With ""fat"" tires it works well; but if your bike has 1.75 tires or less, better seek for another product, as this one is not adjustable for different tire widths. The only adjustable thing are the rubber caps on the feet, which are slightly off center and can be rotated to keep the stand level on uneven floors."

The appeal of this flashlight is primarily the option of 4 x Nichia 219B at this price point, quite a value.  Secondarily, the copper heat sink is efficient and adds aesthetics (though along with some weight).  And it works - nice TIR beam, nice color, nice power.

But those are the only good things I can say about it.  Negatives are:
- Reverse clicky
- Complicated and confusing UI
- weak ano
- chintzy pocket clip
- practical need for extension tube

Details on the above negatives:
- A reverse clicky is a switch where it is activated not upon the press, but upon the release after ""clicking"".  This means no momentary activation, among other things.  Awkward unless you're already used to it.

- The UI is very full featured, too much so.  Too many modes to scroll through using the awkward reverse clicky, having to time your click rate and easy to mess up.  The included instructions on how to use the UI are unintelligible and it took me quite a bit of searching on CPF before I found some that were more usable.  But in general it's such a hassle to use, one is inclined to grab a different flashlight, if one is nearby.

- The aluminum is anodized, but it's not type 3 like olight (for example).  Merely installing and removing the pocket clip scratches it.

- The pocket clip seems like it was made for a different flashlight.  Bulky, it fits poorly and has movement.

- Out of the box, this flashlight uses a 18350/16340 battery.  But the size just isn't practical.  Any advantage in the pocket from its shorter length is wiped out by its large diameter and extra weight from the copper heat sink.  And then in use, the copper heats up so you're left holding a rather stubby end.  Instead, the light is better served by getting the replacement tube (sold separately) sized for an 18650 battery.  The extra length balances the proportions better and the bigger, more common battery provides more power.  Too bad it doesn't come that way, instead requiring you to buy another part.

Now that I have it, I will keep it.  But, if I were able to go back to when I was thinking of buying it, would I still buy it?  Probably not.  Though I do already have a number of other flashlights so my need for this one may be less than others'."

Are people's standards this low? I saw maybe two comments about a diagonal glare, but a whole bunch of comments about how this thing was pretty amazing.  Guess what I got?  A diagonal glare so opaque (depending upon the ambient lighting) that the optic is unusable.  The glare is technically a reflection, since I can get within an inch of the lens and see details clearly, and although I can see a reflection of the emitter, that's only about 20% of what's included in the red haze.  As you move the optic away from your eye (toward the position you'd actually use it) the reflection loses its sharpness and becomes just a red area that you can barely see through.  Since it covers half the lens, that's pretty horrible.  The glare is present whether the unit is on or off, and the only way you can eliminate it is to have the area behind, beside, and above you completely dark.  So inside of a well-shadowed sniper hide, things might be great.  But in my hallway, in the hayfeld, the range, or off my deck, all I see is a 45 degree red slash going from 7:00 to 2:00.  The dot is indeed tiny, however, without the grainy texture of an EOTech.  That said, at least I can see through the entire field of view on every other optic I own.  And at this point, I have nine other optics.  This one is going back for replacement.  If that one also sucks, I'll update this review with the appropriate one star.

  THE UPDATE PART

Well here it is, Halloween, and I packed everything up to head to my range since my replacement sight didn't have the glare that the previous one did. So far so good.  Since ""someone"" told ""someone else"" (on one of these reviews) that the glare was ""acceptable"" it makes me wonder how wide PA's acceptable range actually is.  I am going to try to upload my target photos.  At 75 feet, I sighted in with five rounds of El Cheapo ball ammo in a 9mm SUB-2000, then placed five new target patch dots (maybe a bit smaller than a dime) on my poster board and sent four groups of three, then one last group of two.  Then I cussed really loud and packed my shiz and headed home.  What you'll see is:
shots 1,2, and 3 were kind of tight, at least on one axis, but all three shots were from dead center and to the left slightly.
4, 5, and 6 shifted to the right.
7,8, and 9 fell off to the right a LOT.
Shots 10-12 even more.
I had two rounds left, so I sent #13, and it was so far to the right that I thought my optic was coming loose.  Nope, tight.  The rail?  Also tight.  The forend?  I mean the rail is mounted on it... tight.  So... (head scratch) I clicked windage back to the left 7 times, and didn't even halve the distance back to target on my last shot.  As I was the only one at my range, my cussing was super-loud.  And I flipped the optic off (meaning I gave it the finger) for good measure.  When I got home, I went over the ""reviews"" above, wondering how this thing gets such an overwhelming raft of 5 stars.  Well, good people, go back and read them yourself.
""...haven't put it through its paces yet, but..."" - 5 stars
""...haven't had a chance to shoot it yet, but it LOOKS solid!"" - 5 stars
""...once I get to the range, I'll see how it shoots"" - 5 stars

Well hey, I actually USED my optic.  PA customer service might be the best thing on the planet, but I've now gotten two of these ""5-star optics"" in a row that were so messed up, they wouldn't make good paperweights.  They really wouldn't. They are super-lightweight.  So yeah, some guy thinks it LOOKS good, some other guy thinks it FEELS solid, yet another guy says it has a great dot - and all three of them are right.  But when you USE it, and the dot moves EVERY TIME YOU PULL THE TRIGGER, I'd call that a failure.  Especially when it's on a pistol-caliber carbine with about as much recoil as my toothbrush.

The EOTech I mentioned?  Zeroed it three years ago, running it on an AR (5.56) and POI hasn't budged.

 I'll give you one failure.  Two in a row?  You guys can have this thing back, and I'm not stupid enough to try a third.

Photo upload seems to have worked.  Five photos of 14 rounds.  Notice I zoomed out as the shot patterns enlarged.  Imagine what another 14 rounds would look like.  I'd be off the paper entirely."

It was at a good price and 4x12 with a BDC seemed like a good option for the capabilities of the little .17 HMR. Soon as I got it out of the box I felt as though I had made a mistake in purchasing this scope. First off it seemed cheap, I own several Nikon scopes and this one did not put on anything special before leaving the factory. The magnifier hand piece is made of aluminum not rubber as I had expected based on all my other Nikon scopes. The angles are sharp and its not as visually pleasing as my Pro staff 5, M223, P223 etc..but........ it preforms extremely well. After initial mounting I believed the scope would be short lived on the rifle. Well now I just can't take it off. The gun shoots like a laser beam and can pick off soda cans out to 200 yards with ease. My friend that likes eating squirrel loves this set up too (personally I do not care for them, and will not hunt something if it is not going to be eaten) . All he brings now is a bag for the squirrels and he leaves the shooting up to me, easy head shots with the setup, my record is 3 in under 5 seconds. The scope is a little long for the rifle but I have taken more game with in one season than any other. I have made some of my most impressive hunting shots to date with it as well. As much as I thought I was going to move it I can not allow myself to until I have a reason, and right now there is every reason to leave it where it is."

 But they are still great knives.

I really love an intense workout, and don't think Ive worked hard enough if Im not sopping wet after class.  That said; there is nothing worse than sweat dripping into my eyes during a workout.  I love that this towel is super soft, and very absorbent.  I can keep it near my bag and have it handy throughout the workout.

There are a ton of different gym towels, so its hard to differentiate one from another.  There are a few things that I really like about this one:  its size, its softness, and the little zippered section at the top.  This towel is long enough to wrap around my neck comfortably, and wide enough that I don't have to search for a dry spot when I want to use it.  I hate when a gym towel is so big that its like using a bath towel, or so bulky that it bunches up around my neck.  This one is definitely the sweet spot for size; at least for me.

I started out using ordinary terry cloth towels at the gym, and there is nothing wrong with that.  But, the microfiber softness of this one makes it nicer to use.  And, unlike other microfiber clothes, it actually absorbs nicely.  Finally, the little zipper section in the corner is nice.  There are times when I don't want to leave my keys unattended.  With this pocket I can have my keys with me, in an unobtrusive way.  Its a little thing, but definitely nice. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review."

On a thermarest neoair xlite in an AT shelter and a hammock the next night at 39 degrees wearing thermal bottoms and a fleece top I was toasty and had to unzip it several times thorughout the night.  It's a tight fit and isn't the most breathable bag on the market, but for the price it served me well.  Eventually I stopped zipping it and just used it as a top quilt in my hammock.  For the price, size and weight, this thing really can't be beat.  I just wish it were a little less snug on a 6'1"" 200lb guy and maybe breathed a little better.

Update: After using it for a year and beating the crap out of it, I had it out last night and it's temp rating isn't really holding up. I barely got any sleep at 40 degrees due to lots of cold spots.  This marks the bag's retirement. This is most likely due to me over compressing it repeatedly. I like to try and save volume in my pack and with this thing crunched down in an OR compression sack (weighs a couple ounces less than the one it came in) I can compress this thing down enough to make me very happy.  Unfortunately, repeatedly compressing synthetic bags tightly does shorten the life of the bag and creates cold spots.

This is still a great deal at around 50 to 60 bucks if you aren't expecting much below 40 degrees."

The mylar is high quality and heavier than most standard mylar blankets.  The seams seem to be very sturdy.  My guess is that this will last you several nights or multiple uses.  The storage bag is adequate, nothing special but it is easily seen bright red.  The only ""difficult"" thing about this was folding it back up, I recommend starting at the closed end so air doesn't get trapped as you fold.

I wore it out in public and it was quite comfortable.  I think this will be great for shooting competitions and
self defense.

As far as concealed, it will be great in cool weather with a jacket but I doubt it will be great in hot weather because it does stick out a bit.

That is not meant as a complaint but something to realize if you really need deep concealment.

If stringed improperly, the chance of the string breaking during use is HIGHLY LIKELY.

Assuming you have it stringed properly, this is a nice little pistol crossbow. It's 50lb tension crossbow pistol so it doesn't take as much strength to load and use as the 80lb tension but it'll still take some practice that's for sure.

PLEASE understand this IS NOT A TOY, it is a fully functional pistol crossbow that will injure someone or something if shot at.

Thankfully, it comes with a safety feature that has to be switched off anytime you want to shoot.

It's a functional pistol crossbow that is fun to target practice with right now, and perhaps when we get a better shot....we will hunt small game with it.

It has a pouch big enough to put my iphone 6 Plus phone in it (though pictured is a iphone 5 since I was using my iphone 6 Plus to take the picture), can carry money in the other pouch, comfortable to carry over my shoulder unlike the other one HUGE DIFFERENCE, also I can easily grab it by its second handle and carry it which is a big bonus. The only issue with this one it was a little tight getting the bottle in, in fact it took two of us to get it in the opening, but that that it was a breeze and really is a awesome pouch so it is not even a negative for me.

However, the material is super thin and the inner lining is white...therefore, anytime you bend, the material stretches and appears see-through. Definitely cannot be worn on leg day! I'm honestly surprised by any brand of yoga pants/leggings that continues to use a white inner lining considering this is a known issue for the wearers. So, that was particularly disappointing.
As for sizing, it was slightly small, not enough to complain about. However, the pants have a drawstring waist that seems pointless since the elastic band doesn't expand to the extent that would allow use of the drawstring. So, getting the pants over the waist was concerning.
Otherwise, the pants aren't bad. I won't purchase this brand again but I will still wear them (just only for running)."

If you ever purchase a self defense item to try and scare someone away the most likely scenario is they will steal the self defense tool away and use it on you.

I am sure people who read this review will think I am against these products. Nothing could be further from the truth. I own multiples of every item I listed earlier and after years of carrying them I now carry pepper spray.

I am 6'1"" tall, 260 pounds and can handle myself in most situations. This stun gun will work on someone my size or larger if it is fully charged, you make contact with both points on the end of the stun gun and you can get to a piece of exposed skin on your attacker above the waist or pierce their clothing with the prongs. If you miss even 1 out of those 3 criteria you will give your attacker a slight burn and piss them off even more. Also - the person will recover very fast and you are in the same situation again.

From 5-10 feet away pepper spray will temporarily blind your attacker and put them in more pain than any stun gun on the market. With pepper spray you are at a distance, can use it while running away and if your attacker gets close to catching you it is easy to throw and keep running instead of facing them again and hoping you make contact with a stun gun. You can also spray at the attacker as you are running away.

If someone is blinded they cannot attack you effectively. Look up videos of police officers using stun guns and tasers against people who are on drugs. Then look at videos of people who they use pepper spray on and decide for yourself which one is more effective.

The only reason police officers have tasers/stun guns is because pepper spray is not 100% accurate and if they miss with it or there is wind it can affect innocent civilians in the immediate area - and that is when lawsuits are filed against their department.

Good luck in your choice of self defense weapons."

I have never seen anything like this before so I thought I would give it to him with a few other camping items.  I am glad i ordered it because he loves it!  He said he usually just thaws bowls and utensils from his kitchen into his backpack so he is trilled to have it all neatly in a zippered poch so he doesn't lose them and so he always knows he has utensils packed.  I thought the bowls looked a little small but he said the size is perfect for camping.  They are made real well and fit nicely into the red zippered bag.  I think this is super great gift for the campers in your life.  I also think it would be a great fathers day gift!!!!
I rec'd a discount on this camp set to ty it out and write an honest review.  This is a very well made set, great price and compact so you don't have utensils clacking around in your backpack!"

Just FYI Im an Instructor and know my scuba gear. Also use suit for body surfing and it works fine for me. Dons (goes on) pretty easily considering no zippers. Was concerned about this but needlessly. Suit is a bit too long in arms and legs but is ok for me. Doesnt wrinkle or cause any discomfort due to this slightly too long arms and legs. Diving in FL water temp around 78 now (Dec) and suit is warm. Get chilly at end of Dive 2 but I tend to be chilly anyway due to how slowly I move underwater with my photography needs so not the wetsuits fault.  Will have to see how it holds up over time. Had a BARE mens Large short previously and after pretty hard wear it lasted around 2 years. So hoping for same or better with this wetsuit. So far so good on the cheaper Henderson Thermoprene (vs BARE) fit and function.

For the money this is an excellent tool; as someone else said,it's almost a trapper design pocket knife with locking features. Very fine design.

This is a classic electrician's knife tool design, with the exception that both blades can be locked.  The traditional tool has a liner lock for the screwdriver/knife/wirestripper and the knife blade is simply a slip joint. This knife has a dual lockback design, which is VERY tight. Once you're used to having to turn the knife so the blades point at the floor, to give you enough leverage to close it, the system works fine. I doubt if the locks will ever fail under pressure. Because the locking system is a little tricky, I only am giving four stars; but the tool is a good value."

A greater discrepancy exists with the advertised capacity of 14 ounces. Filling it to just shy of the rim, I measured it at 13 fluid ounces, but the problem is that the cap protrudes about 3/4"" below the rim when screwed on, so the actual capacity with the cap on is around 12 fluid ounces. I imagine for most, myself included, this isn't a deal-breaker - but it could be for some of the hardcore ultralight backpackers out there who measure their gear weights down to the gram.

The product itself is still great: perfect for a small, ultralight water bottle to carry with me in my daypack. I filled the bottle and left it upside down overnight and noticed no leakage.

The price is high, as is typical of titanium outdoor gear products. I found it elsewhere for 30% less, and even at that price it  felt kind of ridiculous.

Overall it's a 5-star product, with 1 star taken off for the misleading product info and the high price."

I washed it and have been airing it out by a window and it still smells so bad I would not want to put my yoga mat or clothes in it. It is also TOO big!?
